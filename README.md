Web Animation Project:

A fashion website built using HTML/CSS and Vanilla Javascript. Includes gsap.js and imagesloader.js libraries. Following tutorial from SuperHi.

In this project I learned: 

How to use gsap.js:

  	.set() and .to() animation
  
  	how to manipulate opacity so that images can run after all images have been loading while using...
  
imagesloader.js libraries, which taught me to:

  	wait for the images to fully load before running a gsap timeline
  
How to manipulate z-index to build a Vanilla Javascript picture carousel

New CSS properties: grid-auto-flow, overflow, perspective, object-fit, and object-position
